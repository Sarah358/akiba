 ## Conclusions
 In this project, i created a REST API that customers can use to view the Transactions stored in the MYSQL database. Additionally,tests were created to ensure the project is running without breaking. TestContainers were also added to simpify and strengthen the tests. Finally, a react app was created to consume the REST API and display data on the browser.
